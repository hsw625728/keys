The level file format is simple. First there's a grid that's 6 chars by 8 chars, like so:

!!...*
**...*
...*.*
.*.***
.*...*
**.*.*
*x.*x*
******

Legend:
	. = space
	* = solid
	! = key
	x = chest
	X = open chest
	o = door switch
	| = left-right door closed
	# = left-right door opened
	- = up-down door closed
	= = up-down door opened

Underneath that is a number, how many moves the level must be completed in, like so:

15

So the whole level file ends up looking like:

!!...*
**...*
...*.*
.*.***
.*...*
**.*.*
*x.*x*
******
15

It should have a trailing newline. Once a level file is complete in a txt file, run convert_level.py on it to turn it into a dat file the game can load.
